# thingsome-app
Sample client to connect and interact with a "thingsome" IOT device.

**thingsome** repo:
https://github.com/codealchemist/thingsome

### Launch

First we need to build the web content:

`npm run build`

Then start the native container (electron app):

`npm start`

### Development

For stuff that doesn't require native integration you can just start a web server and view changes in the browser while you work.

`npm run dev`
